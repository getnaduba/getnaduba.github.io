          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            You don't own your Kindle books. Amazon merely sells you a license
            to access them. That means they can just decide to pull books that
            you've bought at any point and you can do nothing about it. To be
            fair, in practice they generally don't, but they
            <a

              >can</a
            >. Now that
            <a
              href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb"
              >they don't even let you make backups</a
            >, I've decided to move away from the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only real alternative is Kobo, but their books are DRM protected
            as well and they don't synchronize highlights and annotations for
            non-Kobo books.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are great (mostly Android based)

              >ebook readers</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://ewritable.net/comparison-tables/comparison-table/"
              >e-ink tablets</a
            >, all with horrible software. There are great open source projects
            for
            <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com">library mangement</a>
            and
            <a href="https://koreader.rocks">reading</a>, but nothing that just
            works.

          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            You go to this website. You search for a book you want to read. You
            will be redirected to a DRM-free seller, buy it, and it's available
            in your naduba library. Already bought it from some other seller? No
            problem, just upload the epub / pdf.
          </p>
          <p>
            To read it, you buy the e-ink device you want, install the naduba
            app, open it, log in, and your whole library is there. You can make
            highlights, you can attach normal or handwritten sticky notes to
            those highlights. If you feel like it, you scribble right into the
            book.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you finished your book and want to revisit your notes, you
            simply click on the book on this website. It opens, all highlights,
            sticky notes, and handwritten comments on pages were automatically
            synchronized. (With your phone, tablet, and second ebook reader as
            well, obviously.) Btw, we're living in the 21st century, so your
            handwritten stuff is searchable.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the case for all of your Substacks, saved websites, and RSS
            feeds too. Those are ingested and kept in a reflowable text-only
            format so you can read and annotate them on your ebook reader
            without getting eye cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's your library and you own it. Having everything in the cloud is
            comfortable because it enables all of those nice features you just
            used. You still want a local copy. No problem, you simply click on
            the export all button and it starts downloading everything,
            including all highlights and annotations, to your computer.
          </p>
          <h2>The Plan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>1.</b> An epub web viewer that shows highlights, annotations, and
            handwritten annotations from BOOX devices (because that's what I
            bought) on your pc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.</b> An Android app that syncs annotations, highlights, and
            reading progress from the device's reading application
            <i>one-way</i> to naduba. (BOOX only)
          </p>
          <p><b>3.</b> Support other devices, support pdf.</p>
          <p>
            <b>4.</b> The Android app becomes a reader and editor, which enables
            two-way synchronization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>...</b> (we will see about the other stuff when it's time, this
            is a side project after all)
